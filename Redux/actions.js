/*
The idea is that a saga is similar to a separate thread in your application thatâ€™s solely 
responsible for side effects. However, unlike Redux-Thunk, which utilizes callback functions,
a Redux-Saga thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal
Redux actions. Like Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga has access to the full Redux application state and it 
can dispatch Redux actions as well.*/



 // add more actions
